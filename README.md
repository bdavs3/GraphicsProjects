# 2019 Spring Graphics Projects
This repository contains homework projects for computer graphics class, which are all written in C++14 in conjunction with OpenGL / GLUT.  This course mainly covers the theory behind modern graphics, and touches upon various algorithms / approaches to things like drawing curves, performing transformations on 3D objects, and configuring view cameras.  Descriptions for each assignment can be found in the corresponding assignment folders, and the course syllabus is located in the main directory.
## Running the code
The easiest way to run these projects is to clone the repository and open the XCode projects found in each assignment folder.  Press the play button in order to compile and run.  Otherwise, you'll need to run them in the command line with **gcc** after linking the OpenGL and GLUT frameworks (OSX).
